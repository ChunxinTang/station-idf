Purpose


This class contains methods to clean a timeseries, and an implementation of
the fixed maxima and sliding
maxima algorithms provided in

Papalexiou, S. M., Dialynas, Y. G., & Grimaldi, S. (2016).
Hershfield factor revisited: Correcting annual maximum precipitation.
Journal of Hydrology, 542, 884â€“895. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.09.058

These two functions extract the annual maximum precipitation (AMS)
from a precipitation time series. The two approaches arise from the need to account for the
fact that precipitation is systematicall recorded. For example, at a meteorological station,
someone will check the tipping bucket pluviographs at some fixed local time each day which is
then recorded as a "daily rainfall time series" at a particular location. This case results
in "fixed" records, but "fixed" records have been shown inappropriate for
estimating rainfall maxima. Because rainfall is a continuous variable, discretizing it can result
in biases when estimating extreme rainfall, so it is advised to estimate
annual maximum series using the sliding maxima approach.
